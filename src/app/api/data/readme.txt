route.ts Overview:
- Imports necessary modules from mongodb and next/server.
- Sets up a MongoDB client connection using a connection URI.
- Defines an asynchronous GET function to handle the GET request.

MongoClient and ServerApiVersion:
- imported from the mongodb package to manage the database connection.

NextResponse: 
- Imported from next/server to handle HTTP responses in a Next.js serverless function.

uri: 
- MongoDB connection string with placeholders for the username and password.

A MongoClient instance is created with specific options:
- serverApi.version is set to ServerApiVersion.v1.
- strict mode and deprecationErrors are enabled to enforce strict server API usage 
and handle deprecated methods.

The GET function is defined as an asynchronous function to handle the GET request.

Within a try block:
- The MongoDB client connects to the database.
- The function accesses the cli_tools database and the cli_commands collection.
- It retrieves all documents from the collection using find({}).toArray().
- The fetched data is logged to the console.
- The data is returned as a JSON response using NextResponse.json(result).

If an error occurs during this process, it is caught in the catch block:
- The error is logged to the console.
- A JSON response with an error message and a 500 status code is returned.

The finally block: 
- ensures that the MongoDB client is closed after the operation, 
logging any errors that occur during the close process.
